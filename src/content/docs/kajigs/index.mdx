## What is a kajig?
Kajigs are exploits/tools, typically made for use on managed devices.

#### Where can I find them?
Kajigs can be found in [Titanium Network's Discord server](https://discord.gg/unblock) after verifying. Kajigs are located in the `kajig-the-things` category. This category has several kajig-related channels listed below.
  1. `#kajigs-info`: Has information about the various tags/categories that kajigs have
  2. `#kajigs-helpdesk`: A threads channel for recieving help from TN's Librarians.
  3. `#kajigs`: The main kajigs threads channel, for things such as Chromebooks, iOS devices, and Windows devices.
  4. `#webview-kajigs`: Threads channel exclusively for exploits allowing limited, but unblocked browsers
  5. `#read-only-kajigs`: Threads channel containing exploits that are locked. Not much in here, aside from [Galapagos](/kajigs/galapagos)
  4. `#kajigs-discussion`: Talk about kajigs in general, if you use it for help you probably won't get an answer. (See: `#kajigs-helpdesk`)

#### Who makes kajigs?
Kajigs can be posted by anyone with the `Programmer` or `samyk` roles in the Discord server. Webview Kajigs can be posted by anyone.

### What kajigs can I use?

import { getkajigs } from '../../config.ts';
export const kernver = await getkajigs()

Most kajigs can be used in all previous Kernvers. 

For example, Rigtools can be used on any Kernver that can be used below 128, which would be Kernvers 1, 2, 3, and 4.

| Kernver | ChromeOS Versions | Kajigs |
| ------- | ----------------- | ------ |
| Any     | {frontmatter.kernvers[0]} | {kernver[0]?.map(k => <a href={k.slug}>{k.title}</a>).reduce((a, b) => [a, ", ", b])} |
| 1       | {frontmatter.kernvers[1]} | {kernver[1]?.map(k => <a href={k.slug}>{k.title}</a>).reduce((a, b) => [a, ", ", b])} |
| 2       | {frontmatter.kernvers[2]} | {kernver[2]?.map(k => <a href={k.slug}>{k.title}</a>).reduce((a, b) => [a, ", ", b])} |
| 3       | {frontmatter.kernvers[3]} | {kernver[3]?.map(k => <a href={k.slug}>{k.title}</a>).reduce((a, b) => [a, ", ", b])} |
| 4       | {frontmatter.kernvers[4]} | {kernver[4]?.map(k => <a href={k.slug}>{k.title}</a>).reduce((a, b) => [a, ", ", b])} |
| 5       | {frontmatter.kernvers[5]} | {kernver[5]?.map(k => <a href={k.slug}>{k.title}</a>).reduce((a, b) => [a, ", ", b])} |
| 6       | {frontmatter.kernvers[6]} | {kernver[6]?.map(k => <a href={k.slug}>{k.title}</a>).reduce((a, b) => [a, ", ", b])} |

:::note
    If you are on Kernver 1, you can recover to any version. However, if a kajig is listed as Kernver 1, it can only be done below v112.
