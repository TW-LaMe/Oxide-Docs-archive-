## What is a kajig?
Kajigs are exploits/tools, typically made for use on managed devices.

#### Where can I find them?
Kajigs can be found in [Titanium Network's Discord server](https://discord.gg/unblock) after verifying. Kajigs are located in the `kajig-the-things` category. This category has several kajig-related channels listed below.
  1. `#kajigs-info`: Has information about the various tags/categories that kajigs have
  2. `#kajigs-helpdesk`: A threads channel for recieving help from TN's Librarians.
  3. `#kajigs`: The main kajigs threads channel, for things such as Chromebooks, iOS devices, and Windows devices.
  4. `#webview-kajigs`: Threads channel exclusively for exploits allowing limited, but unblocked browsers
  5. `#read-only-kajigs`: Threads channel containing exploits that are locked. Not much in here, aside from [Galapagos](/kajigs/galapagos)
  4. `#kajigs-discussion`: Talk about kajigs in general, if you use it for help you probably won't get an answer. (See: `#kajigs-helpdesk`)

#### Who makes kajigs?
Kajigs can be posted by anyone with the `Programmer` or `samyk` roles in the Discord server. Webview Kajigs can be posted by anyone.

### What kajigs can I use?
Most kajigs can be used in all previous Kernvers. 

import { getkajigs, kernvers } from '../../config.ts';
export const kernver = await getkajigs()

<table>
    <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Kernver</th>
      <th>ChromeOS Versions</th>
      <th>Kajigs</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
    <tbody>
      {Object.entries(kernvers).map(([kv, ver]) => (
        <tr key={kv}>
          <td>{Array.isArray(ver) ? ver[0] : kv}</td>
          <td>{Array.isArray(ver) ? ver[1] : ver}</td>
          <td>{kernver[kv]?.map((k) => <a href={k.slug}>{k.title}</a>).reduce((a, b) => [a, ", ", b])}</td>
        </tr>
      ))}
    </tbody>
</table>

:::note
    If you are on Kernver 1, you can recover to any version. However, if a kajig is listed as Kernver 1, it can only be done below v112.
